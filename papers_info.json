        "abstract": "  We construct a holographic map that reconstructs massless fields (scalars,\nMaxwell field \\& Fierz-Pauli field) in half-Minkowski spacetime in $d+1$\ndimensions terms of smeared primary operators in a large $N$ factorizable CFT\nin $\\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ spacetime dimensions for cases $d=1,2$. This map is\nbased on a Weyl (rescaling) transformation from the Poincar\\'e wedge of AdS to\nthe Minkowski half-space; and on the HKLL smearing function, which reconstructs\nlocal bulk operators in the Poincar\\'e AdS in terms of smeared operators on the\nconformal boundary of the Poincar\\'e wedge. The massless scalar field is\nreconstructed up to the level of two-point functions, while the Maxwell field\nand massless spin-2 fields are reconstructed at the level of the one-point\nfunction. We also discuss potential ways the map can be generalized to higher\ndimensions, and to the full Minkowski space.\n",

        "abstract": "  We propose a dual Wilson loop description for the MHV super form factors of\nhalf-BPS operators in planar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. In this\ndescription, the local operators are represented by on-shell states, made out\nof zero-momentum particles, that are absorbed by a null periodic super Wilson\nloop. We present evidence for this duality at weak coupling, by performing an\nexplicit calculation of the Wilson loop matrix elements through one loop. At\ntree level, the interactions localize at the cusps of the loop, revealing a\nsimple connection between the super form factors and the $m=2$ tree\namplituhedron. At loop level, we show that the Wilson loop calculation\nreproduces the known results for the super form factors. Inspired by this\nduality, we extend the OPE program developed for the form factors of the\nLagrangian to the super form factors of the higher-charge operators. We\nintroduce non-perturbative axioms and conjectures for the main building blocks\nthat govern the exchange of the lightest flux-tube excitations. These blocks\nappear as simple refinements of the form factor transitions introduced in\nearlier OPE studies. They are expressed at any value of the 't Hooft coupling\nin terms of the tilted Beisert-Eden-Staudacher kernel. We carry out checks of\nour conjectures up to two loops at weak coupling for three- and four-point form\nfactors of half-BPS operators of various lengths, finding perfect agreement\nwith perturbative data.\n",

Specifically, we study the spectral density following a quench in\nthe tilted quantum Ising model, and show that the evolution of the spectral\ndensity is a powerful diagnostic. Small transition bubbles are more common than\nlarge ones, and we see characteristic differences in the size dependence of\nbubble lifetimes even well below the critical size for false vacuum decay.

In such\nmodification, the black holes now can be seen as a horizenless exotic compact\nobject (ECO). In this paper, we consider the properties of Kerr-like ECOs in\nnear-extremal condition using Kerr/CFT correspondence. We study the quasinormal\nmodes and absorption cross-section in that background and compare these by\nusing CFT dual computation. The corresponding dual CFT one needs to incorporate\nfinite size/finite $N$ effects in the dual CFT terminology. We also extend the\ndual CFT analysis for higher spin perturbations such as photon and graviton. We\nfind consistency between properties of the ECOs from gravity sides and from CFT\nsides. The quasinormal mode spectrum is in line with non-extreme case, where\nthe differences are in the length of the circle, on which the dual CFT lives,\nand phase shift of the incoming perturbation. The absorption cross-section has\noscillatory feature that start to disappear near extremal limit. The particle\nspin determines the phase shift and conformal weight. We also obtain that the\necho time-delay depends on the position of the membrane and extremality of the\nECOs.\n",

To\ncircumvent the problem, we put the black hole in a cavity as a toy model, and\nstudy the entropy behavior of the system with different temperatures. By\nanalyzing gauge fluctuations with nontrivial boundary conditions, we find that\nthe entropy of the black hole system increases at the end stage, rather than\ndirectly dropping to zero.

As a milestone towards the computation of these functions\nto four-loop order in QCD, we compute all contributions to the pure-singlet\nquark-quark splitting functions that involve two closed fermion loops. The\nsplitting functions are extracted from the pole terms of off-shell operator\nmatrix elements, and the workflow for their calculation is outlined.

In this paper, we study holographic entanglement\nentropy under bulk RG flow and find that it is indeed invariant.

We explicitly show that in several simple examples,\nholographic entanglement entropy calculated in the UV theory agrees with that\ncalculated in the IR theory. Moreover, we give an argument for this agreement\nto hold for general tree-level RG flow.

We do not assume\n$X$ began in thermal equilibrium with the SM; instead, we allow $X$ to\nfreeze-in from its very weak interactions with the SM. We find $U(1)_{B-L}$ is\nmore strongly constrained by $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ than previously considered.\nThe bounds arise from the energy density in electrons and neutrinos slowly\nsiphoned off into $X$ bosons, which become nonrelativistic, redshift as matter,\nand then decay, dumping their slightly larger energy density back into the SM\nbath causing $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff} > 0$. While some of the parameter space has\ncomplementary constraints from stellar cooling, supernova emission, and\nterrestrial experiments, we find future CMB observatories can access regions of\nmass and coupling space not probed by any other method. In gauging\n$U(1)_{B-L}$, we assume the $[U(1)_{B-L}]^3$ anomaly is canceled by\nright-handed neutrinos, and so our $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ calculations have been\ncarried out in two scenarios: neutrinos have Dirac masses, or, right-handed\nneutrinos acquire Majorana masses. In the latter scenario, we comment on the\nadditional implications of thermalized right-handed neutrinos decaying during\nBBN. We also briefly consider the possibility that $X$ decays into dark sector\nstates. If these states behave as radiation, we find weaker constraints,\nwhereas if they are massive, there are stronger constraints, though now from\n$\\Delta N_{\\rm eff} < 0$.\n",

        "title": "Uncovering New Higgses in the LHC Analyses of Differential $t\\bar t$\n  Cross Sections",
        "abstract": "  Statistically significant tensions between the Standard Model (SM)\npredictions and the measured lepton distributions in differential top\ncross-sections emerged in LHC Run~1 data and became even more pronounced in\nRun~2 analyses. Due to the level of sophistication of the SM predictions and\nthe performance of the ATLAS and CMS detectors, this is very remarkable.\nTherefore, one should seriously consider the possibility that these\nmeasurements are contaminated by beyond-the-SM contributions. In this article,\nwe use differential lepton distributions from the latest ATLAS $t\\bar t$\nanalysis to study a new physics benchmark model motivated by existing\nindications for new Higgses: a new scalar $H$ is produced via gluon fusion and\ndecays to $S^\\prime$ ($95\\,$GeV) and $S$ ($152\\,$GeV), which subsequently decay\nto $b\\bar b$ and $WW$, respectively. In this setup, the total $\\chi^2$ is\nreduced, compared to the SM, resulting in $\\Delta\\chi^2=34$ to\n$\\Delta\\chi^2=158$, depending on the SM simulation used. Notably, allowing\n$m_S$ to vary, the combination of the distributions points towards\n$m_S\\!\\approx\\!150\\,$GeV which is consistent with the existing $\\gamma \\gamma$\nand $WW$ signals, rendering a mismodelling of the SM unlikely. Averaging the\nresults of the different SM predictions, a non-vanishing cross-section for\n$pp\\to H\\to SS^\\prime\\to b\\bar b WW$ of $\\approx\\!13$pb is preferred. If\n$S^\\prime$ is SM-like, this cross-section, at the same time explains the\n$95\\,$GeV $\\gamma\\gamma$ excess, while the dominance of $S\\to WW$ suggests that\n$S$ is the neutral component of the $SU(2)_L$ triplet with hypercharge~0.\n",

We discuss two types of millicharge particles (mCPs):\neither with, or without, an accompanying dark photon. These two types of mCPs\nhave distinct theoretical motivations and cosmological signatures. We discuss\nconstraints from the overproduction and mCP-baryon interactions of the mCP\nwithout an accompanying dark photon, with different reheating temperatures. We\nalso consider the $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ constraints on the mCPs from kinetic\nmixing, varying the reheating temperature. The regions of interest in which the\naccelerator and other experiments can probe the reheating scenarios are\nidentified in this paper for both scenarios. These probes can potentially allow\nus to set an upper bound on the reheating temperature down to $\\sim 10$ MeV,\nmuch lower than the previously considered upper bound from inflationary\ncosmology at around $\\sim 10^{16}$ GeV. In addition, we find parameter regions\nin which the two mCP scenarios may be differentiated by cosmological\nconsiderations.

        "abstract": "  Gravitational wave detection has opened up new avenues for exploring and\nunderstanding some of the fundamental principles of the universe. The optimal\nmethod for detecting modelled gravitational-wave events involves template-based\nmatched filtering and doing a multi-detector search in the resulting\nsignal-to-noise ratio time series. In recent years, advancements in machine\nlearning and deep learning have led to a flurry of research into using these\ntechniques to replace matched filtering searches and for efficient and robust\nparameter estimation. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes deep\nlearning techniques to detect gravitational waves from the signal-to-noise\nratio time series produced from matched filtering. We do this to investigate if\nan efficient deep-learning model could replace the computationally expensive\npost-processing in current search pipelines. We present a feasibility study\nwhere we look to detect gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers in\nsimulated stationary Gaussian noise from the LIGO detector in Hanford,\nWashington. We show that our model can match the performance of a\nsingle-detector matched filtering search and that the ranking statistic from\nthe output of our model was robust over unseen noise, exhibiting promising\nresults for practical online implementation in the future. We discuss the\npossible implications of this work and its future applications to\ngravitational-wave detection.\n",

        "abstract": "  Galaxy rotation curve (RC) fitting is an important technique which allows the\nplacement of constraints on different kinds of dark matter (DM) halo models. In\nthe case of non-phenomenological DM profiles with no analytic expressions, the\nart of finding RC best-fits including the full baryonic $+$ DM free parameters\ncan be difficult and time-consuming. In the present work, we use a gradient\ndescent method used in the backpropagation process of training a neural\nnetwork, to fit the so-called Grand Rotation Curve of the Milky Way (MW)\nranging from $\\sim$1 pc all the way to $\\sim$$10^5$ pc. We model the mass\ndistribution of our Galaxy including a bulge (inner $+$ main), a disk, and a\nfermionic dark matter (DM) halo known as the Ruffini-Arg\\\"uelles-Rueda (RAR)\nmodel. This is a semi-analytical model built from first-principle physics such\nas (quantum) statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, whose more general\ndensity profile has a dense core -- diluted halo morphology with no analytic\nexpression. As shown recently and further verified here, the dark and compact\nfermion-core can work as an alternative to the central black hole in SgrA* when\nincluding data at milliparsec scales from the S-cluster stars. Thus, we show\nthe ability of this state-of-the-art machine learning tool in providing the\nbest-fit parameters to the overall MW RC in the $10^{-2}$--$10^5$ pc range, in\na few hours of CPU time.\n",

        "title": "Constraints on charged Symmergent black hole from shadow and lensing",
        "abstract": "  In this paper, we report on exact charged black hole solutions in symmergent\ngravity with Maxwell field. Symmergent gravity induces the gravitational\nconstant $G$, quadratic curvature coefficient $c_{\\rm O}$, and the vacuum\nenergy $V_{\\rm O}$ from the flat spacetime matter loops. In the limit in which\nall fields are degenerate in mass, the vacuum energy $V_{\\rm O}$ can be\nexpressed in terms of $G$ and $c_{\\rm O}$. We parametrize deviation from this\nlimit by a parameter ${\\hat \\alpha}$ such that the black hole spacetime is dS\nfor ${\\hat \\alpha} < 1$ and AdS for ${\\hat \\alpha} > 1$. In our analysis, we\nstudy horizon formation, shadow cast and gravitational lensing as functions of\nthe black hole charge, and find that there is an upper bound on the charge. At\nrelatively low values of charge, applicable to astronomical black holes, we\ndetermine constraints on $c_{\\rm O}$ and ${\\hat \\alpha}$ using the EHT data\nfrom Sgr. A* and M87*. We apply these constraints to reveal how the shadow\nradius behaves as the observer distance $r_O$ varies. It is revealed that black\nhole charge directly influences the shadow silhouette, but the symmergent\nparameters have a tenuous effect. We also explored the weak field regime by\nusing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to study the weak deflection angle caused by the\nM87* black hole. We have found that impact parameters comparable to the actual\ndistance $D = 16.8$ Mpc show the potential detectability of such an angle\nthrough advanced astronomical telescopes. Overall, our results provide new\ninsights into the behavior of charged black holes in the context of symmergent\ngravity and offer a new way to test these theories against observational data.\n",

This leads to a direction-dependent\nDoppler shift of the ringdown gravitational waveform.

Certain binary configurations in the LISA band may\nallow a sub-percent-level measurement of this effect.

We formulate this kick consistency test via\nmeasurement of a null variable that quantifies the difference between the\ninferred kick (using numerical relativity) and that observed via the\nDoppler-shifted ringdown signal. This null variable can be constrained (at 90%\nconfidence) to $\\sim 10\\%$ to $30\\%$ with Cosmic Explorer and to $\\sim 3\\%$ to\n$12\\%$ with LISA.\n",
